# Handling Interrupts in LangGraph

LangGraph provides a powerful way to manage interactive workflows by allowing the server to pause execution and wait for input from the client. This feature is called an **interrupt**.

Below is a clear and simple guide to handling interrupts in LangGraph on both the server side and client side.

## üöÄ Server Side: Sending an Interrupt

To send an interrupt from the server, use the `interrupt()` function. This will pause the flow and send a JSON object to the client.

### ‚úÖ Example:

```ts
const result = interrupt({
  value: {
    interrupt_id: "32835f20-f631-4f0d-9e8e-8b0018bedf50",
    type: "SearchCriteriaWidget",
    searchCriteria: searchCriteria,
    selectedTravellers: selectedTravellers,
  },
});
```

- `interrupt_id`: A unique ID to track the interrupt.
- `type`: The type of widget or component you want to render on the UI.
- Additional fields (e.g., `searchCriteria`, `selectedTravellers`) can be passed as needed.

Once the interrupt is sent, LangGraph will pause execution and wait for a response from the client.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Client Side: Handling the Interrupt

When the client receives the interrupt, it will get a JSON object with the data sent from the server.

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Render the Interrupt Component

Use the `type` from the JSON object to render the appropriate widget.

```tsx
const interruptType = interruptData.type;
const interruptProps = interruptData;

return (
  <DynamicRenderer
    type={interruptType}
    interrupt={interruptProps}
  />
);
```

Use a `switch` statement or `componentMap` to map the type to the correct React component.

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Resume the Graph with a Response

Once the user submits data from the UI, send it back to the server using:

```ts
const thread = useStreamContext();

await thread.submit(
  {},
  {
    command: {
      resume: [
        {
          type: "response", // or any custom type you sent from server
          args: responseData, // object containing user input or selected values
        },
      ],
    },
  },
);
```

This will send the data back to the server and resume the paused flow.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Step | Server                                             | Client                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Call `interrupt()` to pause and send a widget type | Receive JSON object with `type` and other fields |
| 2    | Wait for client response                           | Render component based on `type`                 |
| 3    | Receive submitted data                             | Call `thread.submit()` to resume flow            |

This makes it easy to build interactive flows using LangGraph where the server can ask for input mid-execution and the client can respond with structured data.
